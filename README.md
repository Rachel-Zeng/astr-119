It looks like after merging your first-homework branch into main branch, you repeated a similar process to revert it back? Next time, please make sure your homework files are in your main branch. I can get access to your homework file in first-homework branch anyway. For the line printing your pronounces, it will not work. You need double quotation marks instead as you do for printing your name, otherwise she, her and hers are treated as variables that are not declared. You will receive a full credit this time.

grade: 10/10

Please accept the pull request and merge it into your main branch.
